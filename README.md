KeyGuard AI Vault is designed to provide a robust and secure environment for developers and teams to store, manage, and access their sensitive API keys. This project is developed and managed using the [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) platform, streamlining development and deployment.

## üåü Overview

In the world of AI and interconnected services, managing API keys securely is paramount. Leaked API keys can lead to significant security breaches, unauthorized data access, and financial loss. KeyGuard AI Vault offers a centralized and fortified solution to this critical problem, built with a modern and robust tech stack.

## ‚ú® Features

* **üîí Secure Storage:** Utilizes strong encryption mechanisms to protect your API keys. *(Specifics may depend on Lovable platform capabilities or custom backend extensions)*
* **üîë Access Control:** Granular control over who can access which keys, managed via an authentication system.
* **üìù Easy Management:** Intuitive interface for adding, viewing, updating, and revoking API keys, leveraging a rich set of UI components.
* **üìä Data Visualization (Potentially):** May include dashboards or charts for key usage insights (inferred from `recharts`).
* **üîî Notifications:** User feedback through toast notifications (using `Sonner` and shadcn/ui `Toaster`).
* **üì± Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for adaptability across devices.
* **üé® Theming:** Supports light/dark modes (via `next-themes`).
* **üìã Audit Trails (Planned/Implemented):** Logs all access and modifications to keys for security auditing.
* **üöÄ Quick Integration:** Designed for easy integration with your development workflows.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Environment Variable Management:** Helps manage keys for different environments.
* **üë• Team Collaboration (If applicable):** Securely share keys among team members.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Development

This project is managed via Lovable.dev, offering several ways to edit and run the code:

1.  **Using Lovable Platform (Recommended):**
    * Visit your [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/751032e4-d747-4ca8-8a5b-04501707b58d) to edit and manage the application.
    * Changes made via Lovable are automatically committed to this GitHub repository.

2.  **Local Development (Using your preferred IDE):**
    * **Prerequisites:**
        * Node.js & npm (install with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
        * Git
    * **Steps:**
        ```bash
        # 1. Clone the repository:
        git clone [https://github.com/lalomorales22/keyguard-ai-vault.git](https://github.com/lalomorales22/keyguard-ai-vault.git)
        # 2. Navigate to the project directory:
        cd keyguard-ai-vault
        # 3. Install dependencies:
        npm i
        # 4. Start the development server:
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will start the Vite development server (typically on `http://localhost:5173` or the next available port), with hot module replacement for an instant preview.
    * **Other available scripts (from `package.json`):**
        * `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
        * `npm run build:dev`: Builds the application in development mode.
        * `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
        * `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.

3.  **Directly in GitHub:**
    * Navigate to the desired file(s) in the repository.
    * Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon).
    * Make your changes and commit them.

4.  **Using GitHub Codespaces:**
    * Navigate to the main page of your repository.
    * Click "Code" -> "Codespaces" tab -> "New codespace".
    * Edit files within the Codespace, then commit and push.

**Environment Variables (for Local Development):**
* This project uses Vite. Client-side environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`.
* Create a `.env.local` file in the project root for local overrides (this file should be in `.gitignore`).
* Example:
    ```env
    VITE_APP_TITLE="KeyGuard AI Vault (Local)"
    VITE_API_ENDPOINT_EXAMPLE="/api/v1"
    ```
* **Server-side secrets** (like a master `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for the vault, database credentials, etc.) are managed within the Lovable platform's environment settings for the deployed application. Refer to Lovable's documentation for specifics on managing secrets.

## üöÄ Deployment

Deployment of this project is streamlined through the Lovable platform:

1.  Open your [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/751032e4-d747-4ca8-8a5b-04501707b58d).
2.  Navigate to **Share -> Publish**.

For connecting a custom domain to your Lovable project, refer to their documentation: [Setting up a custom domain](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain#step-by-step-guide).

## üöÄ Usage

*(This section should describe how a user interacts with the KeyGuard AI Vault application itself, once it's running.)*

1.  Navigate to the application URL (either your Lovable project URL or your custom domain).
2.  The application will present a **Login Screen**. Register a new user account or log in if you have existing credentials.
3.  Upon successful authentication, you will be directed to the **Dashboard**.
4.  Use the dashboard to:
    * Add new API keys, providing a name, the key itself, and any relevant notes.
    * View existing keys (with appropriate masking or permissions).
    * Edit or delete keys.
    * (If applicable) Manage user access or team settings.
5.  The application uses `react-router-dom` for navigation. If you attempt to access a non-existent path, a **Not Found** page will be displayed.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

Security is the cornerstone of KeyGuard AI Vault.

* **Strong Encryption:** API keys should be encrypted at rest and in transit. The specifics of this implementation will depend on how Lovable handles data persistence and any custom backend logic.
* **Input Validation:** All user inputs must be validated (likely using `zod` with `react-hook-form`) to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
* **Environment Variables:** Never hardcode secrets in your frontend code. Use environment variables managed by Lovable for backend/build-time secrets, and `VITE_` prefixed variables for client-side configuration.
* **HTTPS:** Lovable typically serves projects over HTTPS. Ensure this is always the case.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies up-to-date via `npm update` and review them for vulnerabilities. Lovable may also provide tools or insights for this.
* **Authentication:** The application has a clear authentication flow (`LoginScreen` vs. `Dashboard` based on `isAuthenticated` state from `AppContext`). Ensure this is robust.

**IMPORTANT:** If your application design involves a master encryption key that *you* manage (even if configured within Lovable), that key is critical. **Losing it could mean losing access to all stored API keys.** Store it securely and back it up in a safe, offline location. Consult Lovable documentation on best practices for managing such secrets within their platform.
