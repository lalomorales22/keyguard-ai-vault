KeyGuard AI Vault is designed to provide a robust and secure environment for developers and teams to store, manage, and access their sensitive API keys.

## üåü Overview

In the world of AI and interconnected services, managing API keys securely is paramount. Leaked API keys can lead to significant security breaches, unauthorized data access, and financial loss. KeyGuard AI Vault offers a centralized and fortified solution to this critical problem, built with a modern and robust tech stack.

*(Note: You will need to define and manage your own backend services, database, and core encryption mechanisms.)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Development

You can edit and run the code using several methods:

1.  **Local Development (Using your preferred IDE):**
    * **Prerequisites:**
        * Node.js & npm (install with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
        * Git
    * **Steps:**
        ```bash
        # 1. Clone the repository:
        git clone [https://github.com/lalomorales22/keyguard-ai-vault.git](https://github.com/lalomorales22/keyguard-ai-vault.git)
        # 2. Navigate to the project directory:
        cd keyguard-ai-vault
        # 3. Install dependencies:
        npm i
        # 4. Start the development server:
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will start the Vite development server (typically on `http://localhost:5173` or the next available port), with hot module replacement for an instant preview.
    * **Other available scripts (from `package.json`):**
        * `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
        * `npm run build:dev`: Builds the application in development mode.
        * `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
        * `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.

2.  **Directly in GitHub:**
    * Navigate to the desired file(s) in the repository.
    * Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon).
    * Make your changes and commit them.

3.  **Using GitHub Codespaces:**
    * Navigate to the main page of your repository.
    * Click "Code" -> "Codespaces" tab -> "New codespace".
    * Edit files within the Codespace, then commit and push.

**Environment Variables (for Local Development):**
* This project uses Vite. Client-side environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`.
* Create a `.env.local` file in the project root for local overrides (this file should be in `.gitignore`).
* Example:
    ```env
    VITE_APP_TITLE="KeyGuard AI Vault (Local)"
    VITE_API_ENDPOINT_EXAMPLE="/api/v1"
    ```
* **Server-side secrets** (like a master `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for the vault, database credentials, etc.) will need to be managed according to your chosen deployment strategy and backend setup.

## üöÄ Deployment

Deployment of this project will depend on your chosen hosting provider and backend infrastructure. You can build the static assets using `npm run build` and then deploy them to any static hosting service or integrate them with your backend server.

Consider platforms like:
* Vercel
* Netlify
* AWS Amplify
* Google Firebase Hosting
* Railway
* Or your own server infrastructure.

## üöÄ Usage

*(This section should describe how a user interacts with the KeyGuard AI Vault application itself, once it's running.)*

1.  Navigate to the application URL (once deployed).
2.  The application will present a **Login Screen**. Register a new user account or log in if you have existing credentials.
3.  Upon successful authentication, you will be directed to the **Dashboard**.
4.  Use the dashboard to:
    * Add new API keys, providing a name, the key itself, and any relevant notes.
    * View existing keys (with appropriate masking or permissions).
    * Edit or delete keys.
    * (If applicable) Manage user access or team settings.
5.  The application uses `react-router-dom` for navigation. If you attempt to access a non-existent path, a **Not Found** page will be displayed.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

Security is the cornerstone of KeyGuard AI Vault.

* **Strong Encryption:** API keys must be encrypted at rest (in your database) and in transit (using HTTPS). You will need to implement the encryption logic in your backend.
* **Input Validation:** All user inputs must be validated (likely using `zod` with `react-hook-form` on the frontend, and corresponding validation on the backend) to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
* **Environment Variables:** Never hardcode secrets in your frontend code. Use `VITE_` prefixed variables for client-side configuration and manage backend secrets securely in your deployment environment.
* **HTTPS:** Ensure your application is always served over HTTPS in production.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies up-to-date via `npm update` and review them for vulnerabilities.
* **Authentication:** The application has a clear authentication flow (`LoginScreen` vs. `Dashboard` based on `isAuthenticated` state from `AppContext`). Ensure your backend authentication and authorization logic is robust.

**IMPORTANT:** If your application design involves a master encryption key, that key is critical. **Losing it could mean losing access to all stored API keys.** Store it securely (e.g., using a secrets manager service) and back it up in a safe, offline location.
